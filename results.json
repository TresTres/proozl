The classical black hole shadow has\nthe maximal size if the luminous background is placed far behind the black hole\nor, more definitely, on the distance greatly exceeding the corresponding event\nhorizon radius. The shadow of minimal size may be viewed if the same black hole\nis highlighted by the internal part of the luminous accretion disk, adjoining\nthe black hole event horizon. In the case of a thin accretion disk this black\nhole shadow is the lensed silhouette of either the northern or southern\nhemisphere of its event horizon (depending on the orientation of the black hole\nrotation axis with respect to a distant observer). The dark silhouette of the\nsouthern hemisphere of the event horizon is seen on the first image of the\nsupermassive black hole M87* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope. The\nbrightness of accretion matter near the black hole highly exceeds the\ncorresponding one of the usual astrophysical distant background in the form of\nstars or hot gas clouds. For this reason, it is difficult to observe the\nclassical shadow of the accreting black hole.", "authors": [{"name": "Vyacheslav I. Dokuchaev"}, {"name": "Natalia O.

Using the derived Eddington ratios, we explore the\ncosmological evolution of massive black holes with an AGN bolometric luminosity\nfunction (LF).

To study details of\nevaporation process, nonequilibrium effects of the net energy flow should be\ntaken into account. In this article we simplify the situation so that the\nHawking radiation consists of non-self-interacting massless matter fields and\nalso the energy accretion onto the black hole consists of the same fields. Then\nwe find that the nonequilibrium nature of black hole evaporation is described\nby a nonequilibrium state of that field, and we formulate nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics of non-self-interacting massless fields. By applying it to black\nhole evaporation, followings are shown: (1) Nonequilibrium effects of the\nenergy flow tends to accelerate the black hole evaporation, and, consequently,\na specific nonequilibrium phenomenon of semi-classical black hole evaporation\nis suggested. Furthermore a suggestion about the end state of quantum size\nblack hole evaporation is proposed in the context of information loss paradox.\n(2) Negative heat capacity of black hole is the physical essence of the\ngeneralized second law of black hole thermodynamics, and self-entropy\nproduction inside the matter around black hole is not necessary to ensure the\ngeneralized second law.
